- Team of four met to deep-dive into convolutional neural networks.  
- Studied CNN architecture, layers and feature extraction techniques.  
- Completed our first attempt at building the pneumonia-detection model.  
- Ran into time constraints due to the high number of epochs and long training time.

- Worked on frontend development (file upload, preview, analysis UI) while training epochs ran.  
- Set up basic HTML/CSS/JS scaffold for the pneumonia-detection interface.  
- Monitored model training progress and planned next integration steps.
